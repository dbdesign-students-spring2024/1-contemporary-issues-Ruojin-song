# The Role of Big Data in Australian Elections  
This document explores two articles that offer distinct perspectives on the influence of big data in Australian electoral processes. The discussion highlights the contrasting views surrounding the use of data analytics in political campaigns.  

## Article 1: 
The ABC's feature on [Both Labor and the Liberals are using secretive databases to help sway your vote](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-19/behind-liberal-labor-data-arms-race-this-election/101074696) posits that big data is crucial in Australian elections because data analysis can influence swing voters who are decisive factors in the election outcome. It details how both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party have adopted advanced data-driven strategies to engage and sway voters. The Labor Party's "_Campaign Central_" and the Liberal Party's "_Feedback_" system are specifically designed to analyze voter data, pinpointing swing voters in crucial electoral districts. These systems enable parties to tailor their messages to address the concerns of specific voter segments, potentially influencing their voting decisions.  

Linda Fenech's case is presented as an example of the effectiveness of these targeted approaches. As a resident of the closely contested Macquarie seat, her engagement with political representatives and response to automated political calls illustrate the impact of personalized campaign efforts. Her decision to shift her support from the Liberals to Babor based on her experiences as a mother of a child with a disability reflects the potential of data-driven campaigns to sway persuadable voters in Australia. Therefore, big data plays a significant role in Australian elections. 

## Article 2:  
In contrast, The Conversation's article [Big data play a huge role in US presidential elections. Do they have the same impact here?](https://theconversation.com/big-data-play-a-huge-role-in-us-presidential-elections-do-they-have-the-same-impact-here-217672#:~:text=But%20have%20these%20methods%20taken,philosophical%20concerns%20about%20the%20approach.) questions the extent of big data's influence in Australian elections because the author thinks that big data is not widely used. The article suggests that Australian campaigns are less reliant on data-intensive techniques compared to their American counterparts due to constraints such as limited financial resources and ethical considerations. It argues that while the expertise for micro-targeting exists, Australian campaigns predominantly focus on broader voter demographics like age, gender, location, and language.  

The article emphasizes that the resource limitations of Australian campaigns often preclude the hiring of data scientists and creative teams to craft tailored advertisements for diverse audience segments. This indicates a more traditional, less data-centric approach to political campaigning in Australia, where the focus is on broadcasting a consistent message to a wide electroate rather than targeting niche voter groups with personalized content.
